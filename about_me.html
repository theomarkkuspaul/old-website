    <p>Hailing from the booming megalopolis of Auckland, New Zealand let me introduce myself: my name is Theo Paul and I am 18 years young.</p>

    <p>I wanna get this out of the way as soon as I can. I have not been to university/college nor do I have any plans to in the near future. My eyes are set only on making the most of this insanely awesome opportunity, Dev Bootcamp. To be honest I feel I will get more out of this program than any tertiary study will get me in terms of real world experience and engagement. Also it means I get to travel abroad, one thing you do not get to do much when you literally live at the end of the earth.</p>

    <p>As of late I have developed a love of coding. I'm sure many of my fellow Rock Doves can empathise with me, but since starting at Dev Bootcamp I have devoured every moment of it with a keen ferocity to learn more and grow and nourish my skills. I have found a common ground between programming and another one of my passions, French. I love speaking and reading French… it was my favourite subject at high-school and I would be very interested in maintaining it going ahead. It has struck me that learning a new language like la langue française and programming are very similar. That is, both have strict rules in terms of syntax arrangement and agreement. While learning french, I have found that you often have to program yourself, in a sense, to imprint and recognise the nuances and conventions of that language. With what I have learnt over the past month or so, I have come to acknowledge this notion. </p>

    <p>I love listening to all types of music. I'm not really opinionated about my taste but here are a few bands which appear last on my Spotify:
      <ul class="artists">
        <li>LCD Soundsystem | </li>
        <li>Unknown Mortal Orchestra | </li>
        <li>Tame Impala | </li>
        <li>Mac Demarco | </li>
        <li>The Modern Lovers | </li>
        <li>James Blake | </li>
        <li>Silicon | </li>
        <li>Flume | </li>
        <li>BadBadNotGood | </li>
        <li>Daft Punk | </li>
      </ul></p>


      <p>As far as sports are concerned I play tennis, table tennis, soccer football, and ultimate frisbee.</p>

      <p>I have competed in a few 48 hour film competitions over the years. I am the reserved sound guy and boom operator. Last year our film got nominated for best high school entry. I love the process and it is always a great time to bond with friends. I am always down to watch a new wave french film by Godard or Rohmer.</p>
