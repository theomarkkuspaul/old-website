##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Through this challenge I have been able to get a good grasp of what each of the positioning values do to an element.
They each affect an element in different ways.
At a basic level padding determines the distance between the content and the border.
The margin value assigns space between one element and another whereas the border goes around the padding and content.
##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Honestly the biggest lesson I have learnt about CSS positioning is how finicky the whole process is.
There is a LOT of rinse-and-repeat tinkering that needs to be done to get an element in the exact position you want.
Often I would switch between my source code and an open Chrome tab to see what little changes need to be done here and there.
It can get real frustrating at times.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Using CSS to change text fonts, text colours, text positioning... anything text based I could get my head around without too much stress.
I found it difficult to position <div> tags!
This took the most time for this challenge, and I wasn't too happy with my final product.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I have realised the power of CSS and how much easier it is to style elements than it is in HTML. I found it interesting how (like the name implies) styling cascades down the HTML file. What's more, I like that being more specific grants greater manipulation of an HTML file. It is awesome that you can target one element to do one thing whilst other elements with the same tag do other actions.
