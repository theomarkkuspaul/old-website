      Here begins the first post of my very first blog.

      As the course progresses, hopefully it will look a lot more crisp as my coding skills improve.

<!-- I thoroughly enjoyed learning the how to wireframe method. One big advantage to it is being able to visualise what the end result of a website will roughly look like. This would bear fruit if you are about to invest large amounts of money into a project. For this challenge I didn't find wireframing to too useful because of how limited my html skills are. I still found it super interesting and had lots of fun just mocking up a rather basic webpage. -->
