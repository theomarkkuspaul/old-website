    <h1>Git and Version Control</h1>

      <p>
        The power and flexibility of Version Control systems, such as Git, to track changes on a file and seamlessly return to "snapshots" of previous work is a significant advantage to using Version Control. Paired with an online database like GitHub, developers are able to push "snapshots" or commits while resting assured that their work will never intrude on that of their peers.
      </p>

      <h4>Version Control</h4>
      <p>
        Version Control allows someone to keep track of changes to files. This can be very important if you need to see or manage how a file has changed over time. Imagine you have reached a dead-end on a problem and need to backtrack. It would be a nightmare to just delete a large block of code - which you have just strained for hours to solve - instead of returning to an earlier version where you know the code is safe.

      <h4>Git</h4>
      <p>
        Ultimately Git is just a program which allows version control to run on your computer. Using Git gives the user plenty of useful features with respect to version control. One of the most important are "commits". Essentially, this is like saving a checkpoint on a piece of work done on a file. With Git you are able to create branches which stem off of a master, like how a tree trunk will support its many branches. When you are working on a file, creating branches allows you to alter the file without changing the master copy. Only until you are completely content with your changes to a file will you merge a branch with the master, thus setting it into stone.
      </p>

      <h4>GitHub</h4>
      <p>
        GitHub's simple push and pull request commands to access work from their online database is one reason why many developers use this service. What's more is the ease of use to get started on a project and collaborate with other users. One click of the button is all it takes to get started using a repository. With your repository all set up, it is not difficult to share what files you have sitting in it through GitHub's forking feature. This allows developers in a team to share and collaborate comfortably. When a file is  committed to GitHub it presents the user with information concerning what alterations have been made to file. GitHub also makes sure these commits do not interfere or deliberately overlap and delete work that other people are doing. The ability for several users to work concurrently is a very powerful feature.
