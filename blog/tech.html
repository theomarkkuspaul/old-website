    <h1>How the Internet Works</h1>

  <p>The internet is a global network of servers, computers, personal devices, radio towers and satellites. We connect to the internet to browse the web, stream music and videos, communicate with family and friends, order items to be delivered direct to your door. The internet is a powerful tool which has significantly advanced the globalised world. Yet if you're not a network engineer you may not know a lot about what the Internet is or how it works to provide you endless content for you to consume. </p>

  <p>A simple way to think of the internet is to think of cars on a highway. The data that your computer requests is similar to how a car might get on and off at different ramps on this huge highway. It gets on the highway wherever the file exists and gets off when it has reached your address.
   </p>

   <p>The way you access a webpage is through hosting platforms called servers. These large boxes of super-cooled metal contain racks of raw computing power and storage. The code for a website is stored here virtually which you download when you visit it any webpage. Every server has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address which allows your computer to find, and be found by, other computers, servers, etc.</p>

   <p>Yet not every computer is a server. For the average internet user they are considered clients because they are not connected directly to the internet. The way you or I are hooked into the mainframe are through Internet Service Providers (or ISPs) which provide your home with the necessary technical means to hook into the internet. Of course there is a lot more that I could say here about DSL connection and all that jazz but I'd prefer to keep things short and to the point.</p>

   <p>The way your computer sends data and information through the internet is by breaking down large files into smaller chunks called 'packets'. These packets are then shot through the information highway until they reach their destination, where they are then reassembled as they once were.</p>

   <p>But if you have several users on a network at one point how does your client receive the correct packets? Well that piece of hardware you have sitting in some dusty corner is called a router. It is 2016 so you should be at the point where it has an inbuilt modem as part of the package. The router assigns each client in the network with a unique I.P. address. When packets of information are sent and received by a server the I.P. address assigned by the router ensures that your packets of data are sent only to you, and not to another random user in the network. </p>
