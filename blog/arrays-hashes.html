  <h4>Arrays -- When to use it? Why use it?</h4>

  <p>Arrays act can be thought of as lists. They can store information in an order. This information can be accessed by entering its index number. One important thing to remember about array indexes is that they start at 0. Calling the first element in an array would go something like this:<br>
    <code>array = ["1","2","3"]</code><br>
    <code>puts array[0] ==> 1</code></p>

    <p>You might store a list of names to be used later:</p>
    <code>names = ["Dean", "Rheubert", "Frank"]</code>
    <p>

  <h4>Hashes -- When to use it? Why use it?</h4>

  <p>Hashes are a collection of pairs of information. In Python, one would call hashes 'dictionaries', which is a good way to think about them. They have a key which is used to access the value, hence the term key-value pair. The key must be unique or else the computer will not know what value to look up. The syntax is a bit different too. Curly brackets are used as opposed to square ones in arrays. </p>
  <code>hash = {}</code>

  <p>Using the same example before, you might use a hash to store information about how old somebody is.</p>

  <code>names = {"Dean" => 30, "Rheubert" => 65, "Frank" => 18}</code>

  <p>We use an equal sign and right-pointing arrow to show which key points to which value. The key-value pairs are seperated by a comma. According to a informed Ruby programmer, when you are trying to look up information, hashes can perform this task much quciker than arrays.</p>
